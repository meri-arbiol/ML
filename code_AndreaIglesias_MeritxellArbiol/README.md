Our code is organized in three different notebooks:

- In the first notebook, called '1_Preprocessing_AndreaIglesias_MeritxellArbiol.ipynb', we have all the preprocessing steps 
for our data. So when we run this first notebook we generate the file "data_salary_preprocessed.csv", 
which is the one we are going to use as input for the other two notebooks.

- In the second notebook, called '2_LinearClassification_AndreaIglesias_MeritxellArbiol.ipynb', we have implemented some of the models:
LDA, QDA, KNN, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

- In the third notebook, called '3_TreesAndOthers_AndreaIglesias_MeritxellArbiol.ipynb', we have the remaining models: 
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and various combinations between models.

- The data is in the data folder, called "salary.csv"
